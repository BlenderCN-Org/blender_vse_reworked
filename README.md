# blender_vse_reworked

A suggestion for reworking the Blender 2.80 VSE menus and additional functions.

New in version v3:

Added:
- Select Under Time Cursor
- Select Channel
- Time Code selection
- Render/downmix audio
- Rearranged the menus in the order the user will need them. Except "View" because of consistency.

What additional edit functions(existing python operators) should we add?


Installation:
Place the two files included into these paths before starting Blender 2.80:

2.80\scripts\startup\bl_operators\sequencer.py
2.80\scripts\startup\bl_ui\space_sequencer.py
